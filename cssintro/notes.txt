/*
Threee ways to add CSS
1 - Inline
2 - Internal
3 - EXternal

selector is the element on which we apply style on 
i:e "The styling Element" for example => h1 is selector;
There are four types of selectors:
1 - element    h1, p , article
2 - id => works by giving specific id to the selectors.
3 - class => multiple selectors can have the same class but not
same id. for example 3 paragraphs having the same class named "para"
4 - group

The priority of applying styles is as follow:
inline > internal > external
