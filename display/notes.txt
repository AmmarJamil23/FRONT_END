We can use display property to make an element view on the browser
It specifies the display behavior (the rendering on the browser)

BLOCK ELEMENT:
div, p , h1
They appear on the sepearte line
They occupy whole space from left to right
They respect custom widht and height
They respect custom padding and margins.
To study about 10 block level elements.

Box-sizing => border-Box

INLINE ELEMENT:
They try to appear in the same line
They have default width as content width
They do not respect custom width and height
They respect horizontal margin not vertical margin.
They respect both horizontal and vertical padding.


We can change that 

USING INLINE BLOCK:
The above property will behave like inline element but 
we can apply custom widdht and height on the element
